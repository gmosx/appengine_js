App Engine JavaScript SDK
=========================

Welcome to App Engine for JavaScript! With App Engine, you can build web applications using the JavaScript programming language, and take advantage of the many libraries, tools and frameworks for JavaScript that professional developers use to build world-class web applications. Your JavaScript application runs on Google's scalable infrastructure on top of Java and Rhino, and uses large-scale persistent storage and services.

This SDK is part of the [Nitro](http://www.nitrojs.org) ecosystem of Web Application development resources. The SDK tracks the latest developments in the <a href="http://commonjs.org">CommonJS</a> group.

This SDK is compatible with [RingoJS](http://www.ringojs.org). An older version worked with  [Narwhal](http://www.narwhaljs.org) and it should be relatively easy to use the SDK with narwhal (some changes will be required though).


Examples
--------

Two examples are provided for the library:

* [appengine-example](http://www.nitrojs.org/appenginejs/appengine-example.tar.gz) - a very simple JSGI application that utilizes the datastore API
* [appengine-blog-example](http://www.nitrojs.org/appenginejs/appengine-blog-example.tar.gz) - a simple blog powered by AppengineJS and Nitro.

The above examples include all the packages required to run them to make setup easier.


Documentation
